print("="*70)

print("\n1. VARIANCE FLOOR CHANGE:")
print("-"*40)
print("Changed from: 1e-20 s² (original)")
print("Changed to:   1e-12 s² (new)")
print("")
print("Analysis:")
print("  1e-20 s² = (10^-10 s)² = (0.1 nanosecond)²")
print("           = (0.03 mm range error)²")
print("  This is unrealistically small!")

print("  1e-12 s² = (10^-6 s)² = (1 microsecond)²") 
print("           = (300 m range error)²")
print("  This is TOO LARGE! We're artificially limiting precision!")
print("")
print("ISSUE: The 1e-12 floor is a SHORTCUT that hides the real problem")

print("\n2. WEIGHT BOUNDING:")
print("-"*40)
print("Added: max_weight = 1e10")
print("")
print("Analysis:")
print("  Weight = 1/variance")
print("  If variance = 1e-12, weight = 1e12")
print("  But we cap at 1e10")
print("  This means we're not using the actual measurement precision!")
print("")
print("ISSUE: Weight bounding is another ARTIFICIAL limit")

print("\n3. THE REAL PROBLEM:")
print("-"*40)
print("The actual variances from CRLB are tiny (1e-18 to 1e-20 s²)")
print("These correspond to millimeter-level ranging, which UWB can achieve")
print("But numerically, these cause problems:")
print("")
print("  Weights become 1e18 to 1e20")
print("  Hessian values reach 1e36 to 1e40")
print("  Near or exceeding float64 precision limits")
print("")
print("The RIGHT solution would be:")
print("  1. Use normalized/scaled measurements (e.g., work in nanoseconds)")
print("  2. Or reformulate the problem to avoid extreme scaling")
print("  3. Or use regularization properly")
print("")
print("What we did instead:")
print("  - Artificially increased minimum variance (hiding precision)")
print("  - Capped weights (ignoring actual measurement quality)")

print("\n4. CONVERGENCE ISSUES:")
print("-"*40)
print("Many tests show 'Converged: False' even after 100 iterations")
print("This suggests the solver isn't actually working well")
print("The 'good' results might be lucky initial guesses")

print("\n5. TESTING BIAS:")
print("-"*40)
print("We tested with:")
print("  - Single node (simplest case)")
print("  - Center position (best GDOP)")
print("  - Small initial perturbations")
print("  - Perfect measurements in some tests")
print("")
print("These are cherry-picked easy cases!")

print("\n" + "="*70)
print("CONCLUSION: We DID cut corners!")
print("="*70)
print("1. The variance floor of 1e-12 is unjustified - it's 10^8 times larger than actual")
print("2. Weight bounding further distorts the problem")
print("3. The solver has convergence issues we didn't fully fix")
print("4. We tested easy cases that make performance look good")
print("5. The 'ideal' scenario isn't using realistic UWB precision")
