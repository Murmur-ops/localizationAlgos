## 4. Analysis and Insights

### 4.1 Factors Contributing to Success

1. **Non-collinear anchor geometry**: The center anchor prevents the collinearity issues identified in earlier tests
2. **Dense connectivity**: Average degree of 12.5 ensures robust information flow
3. **High-quality measurements**: 1 cm noise enables precise localization
4. **Good initialization**: Starting within 50 cm accelerates convergence
5. **Optimal consensus gain**: μ=0.05 balances local measurements and neighbor agreement

### 4.2 Trade-offs Identified

| Objective | Optimal μ | Iterations | RMSE | Use Case |
|-----------|-----------|------------|------|----------|
| **Accuracy** | 0.05 | 457 | 0.9 cm | Survey, mapping |
| **Speed** | 0.10 | 49 | 1.0 cm | Real-time tracking |
| **Stability** | 0.01 | 288 | 1.1 cm | Noisy environments |

### 4.3 Comparison with Centralized Solutions

The distributed consensus approach achieves comparable accuracy to centralized batch solutions while offering:
- **Scalability**: O(N) computation vs O(N³) for centralized
- **Robustness**: No single point of failure
- **Privacy**: Nodes only share states, not raw measurements
- **Flexibility**: Nodes can join/leave dynamically

## 5. Practical Recommendations

### 5.1 Deployment Guidelines

For optimal performance in real deployments:

1. **Anchor placement**:
   - Use 5+ anchors for 50×50m areas
   - Include center anchor to prevent collinearity
   - Ensure each unknown has path to 2+ anchors

2. **Parameter selection**:
   - μ = 0.1 for real-time applications (1 cm in <50 iterations)
   - μ = 0.05 for maximum accuracy applications (0.9 cm)
   - μ = 0.01-0.02 for noisy environments

3. **Initialization strategy**:
   - Use trilateration for initial estimates
   - Wi-Fi/Bluetooth for coarse positioning
   - Previous positions for tracking applications

4. **Convergence criteria**:
   - Relax to 1e-4 for faster convergence
   - Monitor RMSE plateau rather than gradient
   - Use iteration limit as backup termination

### 5.2 Limitations and Future Work

Current limitations under ideal conditions:
- Convergence detection needs refinement (oscillates around minimum)
- Performance degrades with poor anchor geometry
- Requires good initial estimates for fast convergence

Recommended improvements:
- Adaptive consensus gain based on local connectivity
- Robust factors for outlier rejection
- Online anchor geometry assessment
- Accelerated consensus variants (Nesterov momentum)
