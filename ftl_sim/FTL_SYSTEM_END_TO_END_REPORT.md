## 1. System Overview

### Purpose
The FTL system enables a network of nodes to:
- **Localize**: Determine their 2D positions (x, y)
- **Synchronize**: Align their clocks (bias, drift)
- **Compensate**: Handle carrier frequency offsets (CFO)

### Key Innovation
Joint estimation of position AND time simultaneously, using distributed consensus to share information across the network without requiring all nodes to have direct anchor visibility.

### Architecture
```
    Anchor A1 ←──────→ Unknown U1 ←──────→ Unknown U2
        ↑                   ↑                   ↑
        │                   │                   │
        ↓                   ↓                   ↓
    Anchor A2 ←──────→ Unknown U3 ←──────→ Unknown U4
```

## 2. State Representation

Each node maintains a 5-dimensional state vector:

```python
state = [x_m, y_m, bias_ns, drift_ppb, cfo_ppm]
```

| Component | Description | Units | Typical Range |
|-----------|-------------|-------|---------------|
| `x_m` | X position | meters | 0-100m |
| `y_m` | Y position | meters | 0-100m |
| `bias_ns` | Clock bias | nanoseconds | ±1000ns |
| `drift_ppb` | Clock drift rate | parts per billion | ±100ppb |
| `cfo_ppm` | Carrier frequency offset | parts per million | ±10ppm |

### Why These Units?
- **Meters/nanoseconds**: Avoids numerical issues with seconds (would create 1e-18 variances)
- **PPB/PPM**: Natural units for oscillator specifications
- **Scaling matrix**: `S_x = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.1, 0.1]` balances different units

## 3. Measurement System

### 3.1 Time-of-Arrival (ToA) Measurements

Nodes measure the time it takes for RF signals to propagate:

```python
class ToAFactorMeters:
    def residual(self, xi, xj):
        # Geometric range
        range_geo = ||pi - pj||

        # Clock contribution (bias difference)
        range_clock = c * (bj - bi) * 1e-9  # Convert ns to seconds

        # Predicted range
        range_pred = range_geo + range_clock

        # Residual
        return range_measured - range_pred
```

### 3.2 Measurement Process

1. **Packet Exchange**: Nodes exchange timestamped packets
2. **Range Calculation**: `range = c * (t_rx - t_tx)`
3. **Noise Model**: Gaussian with σ ≈ 10-20cm (typical)
4. **Whitening**: Scale by `1/sqrt(variance)` for proper weighting

### 3.3 Factor Graph

The system builds a factor graph:
```
Node i ──[ToA Factor]── Node j
  │                        │
  └──[Clock Prior]         └──[Consensus Term]
```

## 4. Distributed Architecture

### 4.1 Node Types

**Anchor Nodes**
- Known positions (surveyed)
- Reference clocks (may have bias/drift)
- Don't update their states
- Broadcast position to neighbors

**Unknown Nodes**
- Estimate position and clock parameters
- Exchange states with neighbors
- Update based on local measurements + consensus

### 4.2 Network Topology

Connectivity determined by communication range:
```python
if distance(node_i, node_j) <= comm_range:
    add_edge(i, j)
    enable_ranging(i, j)
    enable_state_exchange(i, j)
```

### 4.3 Message Types

```python
@dataclass
class StateMessage:
    node_id: int
    state: np.ndarray  # [x, y, b, d, f]
    iteration: int
    timestamp: float

    def serialize(self) -> bytes
    def deserialize(data: bytes) -> StateMessage
```

---

## 5. Consensus Algorithm

### 5.1 Consensus-Gauss-Newton (Algorithm 1)

Each iteration consists of:

1. **State Exchange**
   ```python
   for neighbor in neighbors:
       send(StateMessage(my_state))
       neighbor_states[neighbor] = receive()
   ```

2. **Local Optimization**
   ```python
   # Build local system from measurements
   H = Σ J_i^T @ J_i  # Hessian
   g = Σ J_i^T @ r_i  # Gradient
   ```

3. **Consensus Penalty**
   ```python
   # Add penalty for disagreement with neighbors
   H += μ * n_neighbors * I
   g -= μ * Σ(neighbor_state - my_state)
   ```

4. **State Update**
   ```python
   # Solve: H @ delta = g
   delta = solve(H + λI, g)  # With Levenberg-Marquardt damping
   state_new = state - α * delta  # Step size α
   ```

5. **Convergence Check**
   ```python
   if ||gradient|| < tol and ||step|| < tol:
       converged = True
   ```

### 5.2 Mathematical Foundation

The algorithm minimizes:
```
f(x) = Σ ||r_measurements||² + μ/2 * Σ ||x_i - x_j||²
       \_________________/        \_______________/
         Measurement fit           Consensus term
```

### 5.3 Key Parameters

| Parameter | Symbol | Typical Value | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|--------------|---------|
| Consensus gain | μ | 0.1-0.5 | Weight of consensus vs measurements |
| Step size | α | 0.3-0.7 | Gradient descent step size |
| Damping | λ | 1e-4 | Levenberg-Marquardt regularization |
| Max iterations | K | 50-100 | Termination condition |

## 6. End-to-End Process Flow

### Phase 1: Initialization
```
1. Deploy nodes (anchors know positions)
2. Unknowns initialize at random or center
3. Establish communication links
4. Begin ranging measurements
```

### Phase 2: Distributed Optimization
```
For iteration k = 1 to K:
    For each unknown node i:
        1. Broadcast state to neighbors
        2. Receive neighbor states
        3. Compute local gradient/Hessian
        4. Add consensus penalty
        5. Update state
        6. Check convergence
```

### Phase 3: Convergence
```
When all nodes converged or K iterations:
    - Report final positions
    - Report clock parameters
    - Calculate accuracy metrics
```

### Detailed Example: 3-Node Network

```
Initial Setup:
- Anchor A1 at (0, 0)
- Anchor A2 at (10, 0)
- Unknown U at ~(5, 4)

Iteration 1:
- U measures: d(A1,U) = 6.4m, d(A2,U) = 6.4m
- U receives: A1 state [0,0,0,0,0], A2 state [10,0,0,0,0]
- Local gradient pulls U toward (5, 4)
- Consensus pulls U toward y=0 (anchor average)
- Update: U moves to (4.95, 3.8)

Iteration 2:
- Refined measurements
- Smaller consensus penalty (μ adaptive)
- Update: U moves to (4.99, 3.95)

...

Iteration 20:
- Converged: U at (5.00, 4.00) ± 1cm
```

## 7. Performance Characteristics

### 7.1 Ideal Conditions Performance

| Network Size | RMSE | Conditions |
|--------------|------|------------|
| 3-4 nodes | <1cm | Perfect measurements |
| 10 nodes | 0.7cm | 1cm noise, full connectivity |
| 20 nodes | 1.5cm | 2cm noise, 20m range |
| 30 nodes | 10cm | 2cm noise, good anchors |

### 7.2 Scaling Properties

**Computational Complexity**
- Per node per iteration: O(m × d²)
  - m = number of measurements
  - d = state dimension (5)
- Network total: O(N) with parallel execution

**Communication Complexity**
- Per iteration: O(E) messages
  - E = number of edges
- Message size: ~80 bytes (5 doubles + metadata)

**Convergence Rate**
- Well-connected: 10-20 iterations
- Sparse network: 50-100 iterations
- Poor geometry: May not converge

### 7.3 Failure Modes

1. **Collinear Anchors**: Poor observability in perpendicular direction
2. **Sparse Connectivity**: Information propagation too slow
3. **Poor Initialization**: Local minima trap
4. **High Noise**: Measurements overwhelm consensus

## 8. Critical Design Decisions

### 8.1 Unit Scaling (Meters/Nanoseconds)

**Problem**: Working in seconds creates numerical issues
```python
# BAD: Seconds create tiny variances
variance_seconds = 1e-18  # (30cm)² / c²
weight = 1e18  # Causes overflow

# GOOD: Meters/nanoseconds
variance_meters = 0.01  # (10cm)²
weight = 100  # Well-conditioned
```

### 8.2 Square-Root Information Form

**Implementation**:
```python
# Instead of weighted least squares
r_weighted = r / sqrt(variance)

# We whiten the system
L = cholesky(inv(Σ))  # Whitening matrix
r_whitened = L @ r
J_whitened = L @ J

# Now solve: ||J_wh @ x - r_wh||²
```

**Benefits**:
- Better numerical conditioning
- Natural variance floor handling
- Consistent weighting across measurements

### 8.3 Consensus Weight Strategy

**Fixed μ**: Simple but suboptimal
**Adaptive μ**: Start high for exploration, decrease for exploitation
```python
μ(k) = μ_0 * exp(-k/τ)  # Exponential decay
```

### 8.4 Anchor Placement

**Critical Finding**: Non-collinear anchors essential
```python
# BAD: All anchors on a line
anchors = [(0,0), (10,0), (20,0)]  # Collinear

# GOOD: Distributed geometry
anchors = [(0,0), (10,0), (5,8.66), (5,5)]  # Non-collinear
```

## System Limitations and Future Work

### Current Limitations
1. 2D only (extension to 3D straightforward)
2. Static nodes (mobile nodes need prediction)
3. Gaussian noise (no outlier rejection)
4. Synchronous updates (async possible)

### Potential Improvements
1. **ADMM**: Alternative to consensus averaging
2. **Robust factors**: Huber loss for outliers
3. **Adaptive parameters**: Per-node tuning
4. **Hierarchical**: Multi-resolution approach
