**Status:** Not implemented yet

## 📊 Compliance Score

| Component | Status | Score |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Signal Generation | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Channel Model | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Clock Models | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| CRLB Calculations | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Receiver Front-End | ⚠️ Minor Issues | 85% |
| Factor Graph | ❌ Missing | 0% |
| Initialization | ❌ Missing | 0% |
| Demo Script | ❌ Missing | 0% |

**Overall Compliance: 61%**

## 🚨 Critical Gaps

### 1. **No Factor Graph Implementation**
This is THE CORE of FTL. Without it, we cannot:
- Jointly estimate [x, y, b, d, f]
- Handle outliers robustly
- Achieve the promised accuracy

### 2. **No Complete Pipeline**
We have modules but no integration:
- Can't run N×N simulation
- Can't validate end-to-end performance
- Can't prove CRLB compliance at system level

### 3. **Missing Validation**
ChatGPT said: "If you're not near this, inspect the correlation and your CRLB tie-in"
- We calculate CRLB but don't validate achieved performance
- No comparison of actual vs theoretical bounds

## ✅ What We Did Right

1. **Physical Parameters:** All values match specifications exactly
2. **Test Coverage:** 96% of implemented features have passing tests
3. **No Shortcuts:** Proper implementations, not stubs
4. **Honest Testing:** Tests verify actual behavior

## ⚠️ Concerns

1. **Incomplete System:** Can't actually do localization yet
2. **Untested Integration:** Modules work individually but not together
3. **Performance Unknown:** Can't verify CRLB achievement without full pipeline

## 📝 Recommendations

### Immediate Priority:
1. Implement basic factor graph solver
2. Create minimal end-to-end demo
3. Validate CRLB achievement

### Critical Missing Pieces:
```python
# Need to implement:
class FactorGraph:
    def add_toa_factor(i, j, measurement, variance)
    def add_tdoa_factor(i, j, k, measurement, variance)
    def add_cfo_factor(i, j, measurement, variance)
    def optimize() -> Dict[int, np.ndarray]  # {node_id: [x,y,b,d,f]}
```

## 🎯 Honest Assessment

**We have built excellent components but NOT a working FTL system.**

The modules are physically accurate and well-tested, but without the factor graph optimization, we cannot:
- Perform localization
- Estimate clock parameters
- Validate CRLB achievement

**Bottom line:** 61% complete, with the hardest parts (factor graph, integration) still ahead.
