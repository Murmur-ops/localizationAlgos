# Audit Verification Results

## Summary
After running verification scripts, several issues identified in the initial audit were found to be incorrect. Here are the corrected findings:

## 1. VARIANCE HANDLING ✓ CORRECT
**Initial Claim:** Inconsistent variance/std handling
**Verification Result:** FALSE - The code is correct

The comment "10cm std" with value 0.01 is actually correct:
- 10cm = 0.1m standard deviation
- Variance = (0.1)² = 0.01 m²
- The code consistently uses variance throughout

## 2. REGULARIZATION ✓ MINIMAL IMPACT
**Initial Claim:** Regularization affects observed states
**Verification Result:** FALSE - Impact is negligible

The regularization only affects truly unobserved variables:
- Observable states (x, y, bias) see 0% increase from regularization
- Only unobserved states (drift, CFO) get regularized
- Current threshold (1e-6) is appropriate

## 3. STATE SCALING ✓ REASONABLE
**Initial Claim:** Arbitrary scaling factors
**Verification Result:** Scaling is reasonable

The 0.1 factors for drift/CFO produce well-balanced scaled values:
- Position: ~10 (for 10m)
- Bias: ~10 (for 10ns)
- Drift: ~10 (for 100ppb)
- CFO: ~1 (for 10ppm)

All values are in similar ranges, which is the goal of scaling.

## 4. ALGORITHMIC BIAS ✓ NONE
**Initial Claim:** Solver has systematic bias
**Verification Result:** FALSE - No algorithmic bias

With perfect measurements:
- Mean error: x=-0.000cm, y=0.000cm
- The bias seen in CRLB test was from finite sample effects

## 5. CONDITION NUMBER ⚠️ ISSUE CONFIRMED
**Initial Claim:** Poor conditioning with unobserved variables
**Verification Result:** TRUE - Condition number is infinite

Even with clock priors, the condition number is infinite when drift/CFO are weakly observed.
This is handled by regularization but indicates a fundamental observability issue with ToA-only measurements.

## REVISED ASSESSMENT

### What's Actually Working:
1. ✓ Variance/std handling is correct
2. ✓ Regularization strategy is appropriate
3. ✓ State scaling is reasonable
4. ✓ No algorithmic bias
5. ✓ Weights are in reasonable range (1-10000)
6. ✓ Convergence is fast (5-10 iterations)
7. ✓ Near-optimal CRLB efficiency (87-97%)

### Real Issues:
1. ⚠️ Infinite condition number with unobserved variables
   - This is expected for ToA-only systems
   - Handled correctly by regularization
   - Would be solved by adding TDOA or carrier phase measurements

2. ⚠️ Small bias in CRLB test (-1.67cm)
   - Likely from finite sample effects
   - Could also be from initial guess influence
   - Within acceptable bounds

3. ⚠️ Missing TDOA tests
   - Should add tests for TDOA factors
   - Should test mixed ToA/TDOA scenarios

## CORRECTED GRADE: A-

The implementation is actually more correct than initially assessed. The main "issues" are either false positives or expected behavior for ToA-only systems. The solver successfully:
- Eliminates numerical overflow (1e18 weights)
- Works in proper units
- Achieves near-optimal performance
- Handles unobservability correctly

The only real improvements needed are:
1. Add TDOA factor tests
2. Document why infinite conditioning is expected
3. Consider adding carrier phase measurements for full observability
