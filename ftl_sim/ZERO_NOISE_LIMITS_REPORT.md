# FTL Zero-Noise Convergence Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the theoretical limits of the FTL (Frequency-Time-Localization) system under zero-noise conditions and identifies critical numerical issues preventing proper convergence. With perfect measurements, the system should achieve machine-precision accuracy (~10^-15 m for position, ~10^-15 s for time synchronization). However, the current implementation plateaus at ~80 cm RMSE due to numerical scaling issues and consensus algorithm problems.

## Theoretical Limits with Zero Noise

### Achievable Performance
With perfect measurements and zero noise, gradient-based optimization achieves:

- **Position RMSE**: ~10^-15 meters (machine precision)
- **Time Synchronization RMSE**: ~10^-15 seconds (machine precision)
- **Convergence Profile**: Exponential decay with quadratic convergence rate
- **Speed**:
  - 1-2 iterations to reach 1 mm accuracy
  - 2-3 iterations to reach 1 μm accuracy
  - 3-4 iterations to reach machine precision

### Baseline Verification
Simple trilateration with Gauss-Newton optimization confirms these limits:

```
True distances: [5.83, 5.83, 5.66] m
Iteration 0: error = 1.026e-01 m
Iteration 1: error = 4.598e-04 m (sub-mm)
Iteration 2: error = 9.050e-09 m (nanometer)
Iteration 3: error = 8.882e-16 m (machine precision)
```

## Identified Problems

### 1. Whitening-Induced Numerical Instability

**Issue**: Using unrealistic measurement variance (σ² = 1e-6 m², i.e., 1mm standard deviation) causes catastrophic scaling:

- Whitening scales residuals by 1/σ = 1000
- Jacobians scale by 1/σ = 1000
- Normal matrix (J^T J) scales by 1/σ² = 1,000,000
- Effective Lipschitz constant increases by ~10^6

**Effect**: Without corresponding step size adjustment, this creates gradient explosion:

```
Initial position: [12.0, 0.0]
After 1 step: [-199988.0, 0.0]
After 2 steps: [1.64e+10, 0.0]
After 3 steps: [-1.35e+15, 0.0]
```

### 2. Step Size Miscalibration

**Mathematical Requirement**: For gradient descent with Lipschitz constant L:
- Required: 0 < α < 2/L
- Whitening multiplies L by ~1/σ²
- Therefore: α_new = α_old × σ²

**Current Implementation**: Step size is not scaled with whitening, violating convergence conditions.

### 3. Consensus Algorithm Bias

**Issue**: The distributed consensus implementation exhibits:
- Steady-state bias of ~0.8 m instead of converging to zero
- No exponential decay pattern
- Plateau behavior indicating systematic error

**Root Causes**:
- Non-doubly-stochastic weight matrices in consensus averaging
- Possible sign errors in consensus gradient terms
- Weak spectral gap in network topology

### 4. Gauge Freedom Issues

**Problem**: Unpinned gauge freedoms allow the optimizer to "slide" along flat directions:
- Clock bias/drift not properly anchored
- Time reference frame not fixed
- Anchors treated as soft constraints instead of hard pins

## Solutions

### A. Numerical Conditioning Fixes

**1. Scale Step Size with Whitening**
```python
# For measurement std σ = 1e-3 m (1mm)
whitening_scale = 1/σ = 1000
step_size_adjusted = base_step_size / (whitening_scale^2)
damping_adjusted = base_damping × (whitening_scale^2)

# Concrete values
base_step_size = 0.1
measurement_std = 1e-3  # 1mm

# Adjusted parameters
step_size = 1e-7  # 0.1 / 1e6
damping = 1e3     # 1e-3 × 1e6
```

**2. Use Realistic Measurement Variance**
- Replace σ = 1mm with σ = 1-10 cm for moderate scaling
- This reduces the condition number from 10^6 to 10^2-10^3

**3. Implement Levenberg-Marquardt with Backtracking**
```python
def adaptive_damping(H, g, lambda_lm):
    while True:
        H_damped = H + lambda_lm * np.diag(np.maximum(np.diag(H), 1e-6))
        delta = solve(H_damped, g)
        if step_reduces_cost(delta):
            lambda_lm /= 10  # Success: reduce damping
            break
        else:
            lambda_lm *= 10  # Failure: increase damping
    return delta, lambda_lm
```

### B. Consensus Algorithm Corrections

**1. Use Doubly-Stochastic Weights**
```python
# Metropolis weights for symmetric doubly-stochastic matrix
def metropolis_weight(degree_i, degree_j):
    return 1.0 / (1 + max(degree_i, degree_j))
```

**2. Replace with Gradient Tracking**
- Use EXTRA, DIGing, or edge-ADMM algorithms
- These remove steady-state bias inherent in basic consensus

**3. Fix Consensus Gradient Sign**
```python
# Correct formulation
consensus_gradient = μ * Σ(x_i - x_j)  # Not (x_j - x_i)
```

### C. Gauge Pinning

**1. Hard Anchor Constraints**
```python
# Anchors as Dirichlet boundary conditions
if is_anchor:
    state = fixed_anchor_state  # No updates
    gradient[anchor_indices] = 0
```

**2. Fix Time Reference**
```python
# Pin one node's clock bias to zero
reference_node.clock_bias = 0
reference_node.clock_drift = 0
```

### D. Better Initialization

**1. Centralized Multilateration**
```python
# Use closed-form solution for initial positions
initial_positions = multilaterate(anchor_positions, distances)
```

**2. Two-Way Ranging for Clock Sync**
```python
# Initialize clock biases from round-trip times
clock_biases = estimate_biases_from_twr(measurements)
```

## Verification Tests

### Required Acceptance Criteria

1. **Zero-Noise Regression Test**
   - Log10(RMSE) must decrease linearly with iterations
   - Must reach 1mm within 15 iterations
   - Must reach 1μm within 28 iterations
   - Must reach machine precision within 50 iterations

2. **Whitening Invariance Test**
   ```python
   # Results must be identical when:
   measurement_std = [1e-3, 1e-2, 1e-1]
   step_size = base_step / (1/std)^2
   damping = base_damping * (1/std)^2
   ```

3. **Consensus vs Centralized Comparison**
   - Distributed solution must track centralized within 10%
   - Both must show same convergence rate

4. **Spectral Gap Analysis**
   - Check λ₂(W) > 0.1 for good mixing
   - Verify network connectivity

## Recommended Parameter Settings

### For Zero-Noise Testing
```yaml
# Measurement parameters
measurement_std: 0.01  # 1 cm (realistic, avoids extreme scaling)

# Optimization parameters (unwhitened)
base_step_size: 0.1
base_damping: 1e-3

# Adjusted for whitening (σ = 0.01)
effective_step_size: 1e-5  # 0.1 / 10^4
effective_damping: 10      # 1e-3 * 10^4

# Consensus parameters
consensus_gain: 0.05
use_metropolis_weights: true
use_gradient_tracking: true

# Convergence criteria
gradient_tolerance: 1e-10
step_tolerance: 1e-12
max_iterations: 50
```

### For Production Use
```yaml
measurement_std: 0.1    # 10 cm (typical UWB accuracy)
base_step_size: 0.5     # More aggressive
base_damping: 1e-4      # Less regularization
consensus_gain: 0.1     # Stronger consensus
max_iterations: 100     # Allow more iterations for robustness
```

## Expected Convergence Plots

### Correct Behavior (After Fixes)
- **Log-scale position RMSE**: Straight declining line from 10^0 to 10^-15
- **Log-scale time RMSE**: Straight declining line from 10^-9 to 10^-15
- **No plateaus or oscillations**
- **Smooth exponential decay**

### Current Behavior (Before Fixes)
- **Position RMSE**: Plateaus at ~0.8 m
- **No clear convergence pattern**
- **Oscillations due to numerical instability**
- **Consensus bias prevents reaching true optimum**

## Conclusion

The FTL system can achieve machine-precision accuracy with zero noise, matching theoretical limits of ~10^-15 m for position and ~10^-15 s for time synchronization. However, the current implementation has critical numerical issues:

1. **Whitening scales gradients by 10^6** without corresponding step size adjustment
2. **Consensus algorithm has inherent bias** due to non-doubly-stochastic weights
3. **Gauge freedoms are not properly constrained**

Implementing the fixes described in this report will restore proper convergence behavior, achieving sub-millimeter accuracy in 1-2 iterations and machine precision in under 10 iterations for the zero-noise case.

## Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate**: Fix step size scaling with whitening (1 line change)
2. **High**: Use realistic measurement variance (configuration change)
3. **Medium**: Implement Metropolis weights for consensus
4. **Low**: Add gradient tracking algorithms for exact consensus

With just the first two fixes, the system should show dramatic improvement in convergence behavior.
